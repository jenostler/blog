			<h2>Why Quitting Was the Best Thing I've Ever Done</h2>
			<h5 class="text-muted text-left">August 6, 2017</h3>
				<p>Let’s be honest, a few months ago, I was miserable. I was stressed, unhappy, and unsure of my next step. I felt trapped, and I felt desperate. I had never felt that depressed in my entire life, which made it all the more paralyzing. I was stuck in a part of life, and in a job, that I utterly wished I could skip.</p>
				<p>Let me take you back a bit to explain how I got to this point. When I took my first Humanities class in college, I was in love. Talking for hours about art, music, literature, theater, film … ahh, that was the life. I truly enjoyed every second of my major. That was a big reason that I chose it. At that time, I admit, I didn’t really have a plan as to what I would actually do after graduating. But graduation was years away; I had plenty of time to figure that out, right?</p>
				<p>Well, those years flashed by, and as I ordered my cap and gown and finished midterms in my last semester, it all started to sink in: my husband still had 2 years left of school, and it was up to me to pay the bills on my own for a while. I didn’t have a job lined up, yet. Or any prospects whatsoever. Or, as a matter of fact, any idea what career I was even interested in pursuing.</p>
				<p>Months of applying for all sorts of jobs, interviewing, and being rejected time and time again went by, and it was all starting to weigh heavily on me. After 3 months of this, I finally got a job! I was extremely excited. I was hired on to work as a department administrator (which is a vague title meaning, ‘do everything’) for an online marketing company. I would be working with an awesome coworker, and together we would run the office. The work wasn’t my passion or anything (but I still wasn’t sure what my passion was at this point), but at least it would pay the bills, and I would be working with fun people.</p>
				<p>Just over 1 month went by, and I was still pretty happy. I loved my co-worker; she made working there fun and was the only other person in the office that understood the ins and outs of the job. Overall, everyone was getting to know me, rely on me, and seemed to like me. I was doing well!</p>
				<p>Until the day-that-must-not-be-named came. The company fired dozens of people company-wide in a single morning. I had no idea that this was coming; no one did. As an office administrator, I was asked to help facilitate getting people out quickly and making sure we had boxes to pack up their stuff while they were upstairs being told they were fired. (Harsh, I know.) Little did I know -- but would later find out -- my friend and only teammate was in that group.</p>
				<p>Let me sum up the next 9 months, here, because it just gets more and more depressing. From that day on, my job changed. It became a stressful, solitarily environment that slowly but surely turned into demoralizing and discouraging drudgery. My asking (and practically begging) for a new co-worker to lighten my load didn’t have much effect on superiors that didn’t really know (or bother to find out) what I did, why it was so difficult, or why I was suddenly less chipper and more overwhelmed each day. I was sinking fast. I fell into a depression. I tried applying and interviewing for other jobs, but I never made the cut. I felt stuck. Other parts of my life starting wavering and declining. My health, relationships, hobbies, and overall happiness started to suffer.</p>
				<p>Enter David, my amazingly loving and supportive teammate (especially vital to the story, since I no longer had any teammates at my job). He was my shoulder to cry on, mentor to get advice from, and, eventually, my biggest supporter of the decision to quit.</p>
				<p>Was quitting a terrifying choice? Absolutely. I grappled with it for months. I wrestled with the questions, ‘what will we do for money?’ and ‘how will we survive?!’ Finally, with a lot of praying and talking with my amazing spouse, I decided quitting was actually the best and healthiest decision I could make. I wasn’t happy at my job, and I knew that nothing was going to change that. The job had changed, and it had changed me too, in a way that I didn’t like. Amidst nervousness for the future, making the decision once and for all to quit suddenly made me feel … calm. I could see a light at the end of the long and dreary tunnel I had been trapped in for a year. I wasn’t sure what that light was yet, but I knew that heading towards it was the best choice I could possibly make.</p>
				<p>So, I left. I told my boss, and I tried my hardest to finish strong and leave the job better than I found it. I offered to stay longer than the traditional two weeks so that I could help train the new me. And, when she arrived, I wished her all the best and sincerely hoped that she would succeed and be supported wholeheartedly by everyone there.</p>
				<p>This experience has taught me a lot about myself and a lot about the importance of keeping good people around you in the midst of overwhelming trials and vast hopelessness. I’ve learned about sacrifice, perseverance, trusting in God, and holding onto faith and strength until you see a brighter end.</p>
				<p>So, if you are feeling stuck -- whether that be in a job, major, or whatever trial you may be facing -- hold on! There is something to look forward to at the end, and it will make you stronger and leave you better off than when you started.</p>
				<p>As far as how I am doing now? I’m happy. I took a summer off to rejuvenate, to grow, to learn, to laugh, and to focus on myself and my happiness.</p>
				<p>What is my career plan, now? Well, that is a much happier and more more exciting story. But, you’ll just have to wait until my next post to find out what my newest adventure is now!</p>
